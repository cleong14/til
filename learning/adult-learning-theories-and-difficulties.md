## What is an Adult Learning Theory?

Adult learning theory is the study that examines how adults learn and master knowledge, competences, and new skills.
Adult learning theory principles are based on the premise that adults learn differently than children.

**Adult learners vs. Child learners**

| **Children**                                                                                                                             | **Adults**                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Child-oriented learning provides a basic foundation of knowledge and helps develop critical thinking skills.                             | Adults have an existing base of knowledge and life experience. Adult students seek out [continuous learning](https://www.ispringsolutions.com/blog/continuous-learning) based on personal interests, wants, and needs. |
| Younger learners typically have no choice but to study and may lose enthusiasm if they are not engaged in what is happening around them. | Unlike children, adult learners understand why they’re learning, so their motivation to learn is naturally high.                                                                                                       |
| It’s necessary to be in charge of the classroom.                                                                                         | It’s beneficial to let adults work things out for themselves and organize themselves.                                                                                                                                  |
| Teachers play a central role in delivering knowledge and guiding learning activities.                                                    | The role of “teacher” may be effectively filled by a mentor, coach, training facilitator, peer, or subject matter expert.                                                                                              |


## Difficulties in Adult Learning

These are a few of the most common difficulties in adult learning.

**Focusing**

Adults generally tend to have other priorities and/or they have too much on their plate, not only at work but in their personal life.

**Seeing the big picture**

If adults don’t see where they stand in the company, don’t feel valued, or know what depends on them, corporate training often may seem unnecessary.
Employees may simply not understand why their employer tries to involve them in corporate training programs.
It’s necessary to show that employee training and development are important for their growth in the company and to make a real impact on overall business performance.

**Having a purpose**

That’s the same old ‘what’s in it for me’ situation.
Adult learners want to know exactly how the new information will help them in life or work.
If the purpose of training isn’t concrete enough and doesn’t target the learning needs of the audience, it may become an unbreakable barrier, and no training will make sense.

**Imposter syndrome**

Adults tend to fear not knowing something they perceive to be essential for their new role, another career path, or a different profession.
Motivation to learn may decline due to the fear of criticism as well.
So, if the training topic is something new for the adult, they may suffer from imposter syndrome, and that hinders their growth and professional development greatly.


## Learning Theory Comparison Chart 

Here’s a comparison chart of the top learning theories for adults.

| **CONCEPT**                   | **SUMMARY**                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **BEST SUITED FOR**                                                                          |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Andragogy**                 | - Adult learners are autonomous and self-directing, and seek out learning based on personal needs.<br>- Adult learners must be able to apply what they learn in real-life situations.                                     | - Problem solving<br>- Structured formal learning<br>- Learners with a defined need to know  |
| **Transformational Learning** | - A person’s beliefs and expectations shape their view of the world.<br>- Through a rational analytical process, a person can consciously change their old beliefs and implement new ones.                                | - Complex analytical processes<br>- Evaluation and analysis<br>- Long-term personal growth   |
| **Experiential Learning**     | - A hands-on approach where individuals learn by doing.<br>- Puts the learner at the center of the learning process.<br>- Learning happens through an active process of doing and reflection.                             | - Mechanical skills<br>- Leadership skills<br>- Process improvement<br>- Systematic thinking |
| **Self-Directed Learning**    | - Process where individuals take complete ownership of the learning process to diagnose learning needs, identify resources, implement learning, and assess their results.                                                 | - Process updates<br>- Self-motivated learners<br>- Technology and software skills           |
| **Project Based Learning**    | - Learners engage in active investigation of a real-world problem.<br>- Gives learners a voice in the overall process through a process of inquiry, critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication. | - Project management<br>- Process improvement<br>- Manufacturing                             |
| **Action Learning**           | - Learning is the result of programming and questioning.<br>- Learners take action on a problem and reflect upon the results.                                                                                             | - Team building<br>- Fill in knowledge gaps<br>- Uncover areas of learning need              |
