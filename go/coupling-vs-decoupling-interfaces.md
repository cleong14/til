## Context

In Go, an interface defines a set of method signatures that a type must implement in order to fulfill that interface. When a type satisfies the interface, it is said to implicitly implement the interface.

Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between two or more components of a system. In the context of Go interfaces, coupling can refer to how tightly the interface is coupled with the implementing types.

If an interface is tightly coupled with the types that implement it, it means that the interface is designed specifically for those types and cannot be easily reused with other types. On the other hand, if an interface is loosely coupled with its implementing types, it means that the interface can be used more generally with a wider range of types.

Designing interfaces with loose coupling is generally considered to be a best practice, as it promotes code reuse and modularity. However, in some cases, tightly coupling an interface with its implementing types can be useful for optimizing performance or achieving other specific goals.

In general, the decision to use coupling versus decoupling when designing Go interfaces will depend on the specific use case and the tradeoffs between performance, flexibility, and maintainability.
