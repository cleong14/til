## [Belbin Team Roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Belbin_Team_Roles)

### [Plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Plant)

Plants are creative, unorthodox and generators of ideas. If an innovative solution to a problem is needed, a Plant is a good person to ask. A good Plant will be bright and free-thinking. Plants can tend to ignore incidentals. The Plant might be caricatured as the [absent-minded professor/inventor](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/wiki/Absent-minded_professor "Absent-minded professor"), and often has a hard time communicating ideas to others. Multiple Plants in a team can lead to misunderstandings, as many ideas are generated without sufficient discernment or the impetus to follow the ideas through to action. Plants can also create problems with the timing of their ideas. The fact that the team has decided on a valid way forward and is now in the implementation stage will not stop the Plant from coming up with new solutions and disrupting the implementation process.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-0" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

Belbin observed, "We called these clever people plants, because the chaps at Henley insisted we plant one in each group".<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>

### [Resource Investigator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Resource_Investigator)

The Resource Investigator gives a team a rush of enthusiasm at the start of the project by vigorously pursuing contacts and opportunities. He or she is focused outside the team, and has a finger firmly on the pulse of the outside world. Whereas a Plant creates new ideas, a Resource Investigator will quite happily appropriate them from other companies or people. A good Resource Investigator is a maker of possibilities and an excellent [networker](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/wiki/Connector_(social) "Connector (social)"), but has a tendency to lose momentum towards the end of a project and to forget to follow things up.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-1" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Co-ordinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Co-ordinator)

A Co-ordinator is a likely candidate for the chairperson of a team, since they have a talent for stepping back to see the big picture. Co-ordinators are confident, stable and mature and because they recognise abilities in others, they are very good at delegating tasks to the right person for the job. The Co-ordinator clarifies decisions, helping everyone else focus on their tasks. Co-ordinators are sometimes perceived to be manipulative and will tend to delegate all work, leaving nothing but the delegating for them to do.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-2" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Shaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Shaper)

The Shaper is a task-focused individual who pursues objectives with vigour and who is driven by tremendous energy and the need to achieve. For the Shaper, winning is the name of the game. The Shaper provides the necessary drive to ensure that the team is kept moving and does not lose focus or momentum. Shapers are people who challenge the team to improve. They are dynamic and usually extraverted people who enjoy stimulating others, questioning norms, and finding the best approaches for solving problems. The Shaper is the one who shakes things up to make sure that all possibilities are considered and that the team does not become complacent. Shapers could risk becoming aggressive and bad-humoured in their attempts to get things done. Shapers often see obstacles as exciting challenges and they tend to have the courage to push on when others feel like quitting.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-3" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Monitor Evaluator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Monitor_Evaluator)

Monitor Evaluators are fair and [logical](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/wiki/Logic_and_rationality "Logic and rationality") observers and judges of what is going on in the team. Since they are good at detaching themselves from [bias](chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/wiki/Bias "Bias"), they are often the ones to see all available options with the greatest clarity and impartiality. They take a broad view when problem-solving, and by moving slowly and analytically, will almost always come to the right decision. However, they can become very critical, damping enthusiasm for anything without logical grounds, and they have a hard time inspiring themselves or others to be passionate about their work.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-4" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Teamworker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Teamworker)

A Teamworker acts as the "oil" between the cogs that keep the machine that is the team running smoothly. They are good listeners and diplomats, talented at smoothing over conflicts and helping parties understand one another without becoming confrontational. Since the role can be a low-profile one, the beneficial effect of a Teamworker can go unnoticed and unappreciated until they are absent, when the team begins to argue, and small but important things cease to happen. Because of an unwillingness to take sides, a Teamworker may not be able to take decisive action when needed.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-5" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Implementer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Implementer)

The Implementer takes their colleagues' suggestions and ideas and turns them into positive action. They are efficient and self-disciplined, and can always be relied on to deliver on time. They are motivated by their loyalty to the team or company, which means that they will often take on jobs everyone else avoids or dislikes. However, they may be seen as closed-minded and inflexible since they will often have difficulty deviating from their own well-thought-out plans, especially if such a deviation compromises efficiency or threatens well-established practices.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-6" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Completer Finisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Completer_Finisher)

The Completer Finisher is a perfectionist and will often go the extra mile to make sure everything is "just right," and the things he or she delivers can be trusted to have been double-checked and then checked again. The Completer Finisher has a strong inward sense of the need for accuracy, and sets his or her own high standards rather than working on the encouragement of others. They may frustrate their teammates by worrying excessively about minor details and by refusing to delegate tasks that they do not trust anyone else to perform.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-7" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

### [Specialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Role_Inventories?useskin=vector#Specialist)

Specialists are passionate about learning in their own particular field. As a result, they are likely to be a fountain of knowledge and will enjoy imparting this knowledge to others. They also strive to improve and build upon their expertise. If there is anything they do not know the answer to, they will happily go and find out. Specialists bring a high level of concentration, ability, and skill in their discipline to the team, but can only contribute on that specialism and will tend to be uninterested in anything which lies outside its narrow confines.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_3-8" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles-3">[3]</a></sup>

The Belbin Team Inventory was revised to include the Specialist role, since the role was not revealed in the original research because no specialized knowledge was required for the simulation exercise.<sup id="cite_ref-Belbin_Team_Roles_History_5-0" class="reference"><a href="chrome-extension://pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi/_generated_background_page.html#cite_note-Belbin_Team_Roles_History-5">[5]</a></sup>
