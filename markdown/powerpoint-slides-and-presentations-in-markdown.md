# 2024-05-04 - TIL - PowerPoint Slides and Presentations in Markdown

There are many tools that allow you to create PowerPoint slides and presentations in Markdown.

Taking into consideration the ease of use of the tools (e.g. creating/editing slides, running presentations, actually presenting the slides using the tools, etc.), little-to-no learning curve, and minimal disruption to existing workflows these are the best tools I've found for creating PowerPoint slides and presentations in Markdown.


## Tools

- [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) - The HTML Presentation Framework
- [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md) - reveal.js on steroids! Get beautiful reveal.js presentations from any Markdown file
- [slides.com](https://slides.com/) - Create and Share Presentations for Free

*Note: Each tool fundamentally runs on [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).*


## Use Cases

- Write PowerPoint slides and presentations in Markdown
- Create/Edit PowerPoint slides visually using slides.com and export to Markdown, HTML, and/or reveal.js for free
