# October 16, 2023 TIL - DefectDojo Finding Statuses & How Each Status Affects Future Finding Statuses on (Re)Import-Scan

In DefectDojo, a finding status may or may not have an impact on future finding statuses.

For example, a finding status of `Inactive, Mitigated, False Positive` _**WILL NOT**_ reopen a finding (set a finding status to `Active`) if found in future scans.

However, a finding status of `Mitigated` _**WILL**_ reopen a finding (set a finding status to `Active`) if found in future scans.

## Finding Statuses

| Finding Status   | Description                                                                                                                                              | Impact to Future Finding Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| `Active`         | When a finding is found in the current scan. Findings are typically set to `Active` automatically based on the reported results from each security scan. | `Active` findings keep the first/original finding set to `Active` while all future instances of the same finding are to `Inactive, Duplicate`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `Mitigated`      | When a finding in the current scan is manually set to `Mitigated`.                                                                                       | Manually setting the first/original finding status to `Mitigated` will automatically set the first/original finding status to `Inactive, Mitigated`. However, if the same finding is found in future scans, the finding will be reopened. When a finding is reopened, the first/original finding status will be set to `Active` and future instances of the same finding will be set to `Inactive, Duplicate`.                      |
| `False Positive` | When a finding in the current scan is manually set to `False Positive`.                                                                                  | Manually setting the first/original finding status to `False Positive` will automatically set the first/original finding status to `Inactive, Mitigated, False Positive`. If the same finding is found in future scans, the finding will not be reopened, the first/original finding status will remain set to `Inactive, Mitigated, False Positive` and future instances of the same finding will be set to `Inactive, Duplicate`. |
| `Out Of Scope`   | When a finding in the current scan is manually set to `Out Of Scope`.                                                                                    | Manually setting the first/original finding status to `Out Of Scope` will automatically set the first/original finding status to `Inactive, Mitigated, Out Of Scope`. If the same finding is found in future scans, the finding will not be reopened, the first/original finding status will remain set to `Inactive, Mitigated, Out Of Scope` and future instances of the same finding will be set to `Inactive, Duplicate`.       |
| `Risk Accepted`  | When a finding in the current scan is manually set to `Risk Accepted`.                                                                                   | Manually setting the first/original finding status to `Risk Accepted` will automatically set the first/original finding status to `Inactive, Risk Accepted`. If the same finding is found in future scans, the finding will not be reopened, the first/original finding status will remain set to `Inactive, Risk Accepted` and future instances of the same finding will be set to `Inactive, Duplicate`.                          |
